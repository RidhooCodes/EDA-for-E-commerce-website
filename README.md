## ShopSmart Customer Behavior Analysis

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and preferences for ShopSmart Inc., an e-commerce platform. By leveraging data collected from their website, we aim to:

* **Segment Customers:** Group customers based on shared characteristics like preferences, location, and purchasing habits.
* **Optimize User Experience:** Improve website usability and user experience based on customer interaction insights.
* **Enhance Marketing Strategies:** Refine product offerings and marketing campaigns to boost customer satisfaction and retention.

**Problem Statement:**

ShopSmart Inc. lacks a deep understanding of its customer base. This knowledge gap hinders their ability to:

* **Personalize the customer experience:** ShopSmart cannot tailor the website, product recommendations, or marketing strategies to individual customer preferences.
* **Optimize website usability:** Without insights into user behavior, ShopSmart may struggle to identify areas for improvement in website design and functionality.
* **Effectively target marketing campaigns:** Broad marketing strategies might not resonate with specific customer segments, leading to wasted resources and potentially reduced customer engagement.

This project aims to address these issues by analyzing customer behavior data from ShopSmart's website. By gaining insights into customer preferences, location, and purchasing habits, we can create a more comprehensive customer profile and use that knowledge to improve customer satisfaction, retention, and ultimately, revenue for ShopSmart Inc. 

**Data Sources:**

ShopSmart Inc. provides five datasets from various website tables. These datasets encompass information including:

* Customer IDs
* Device IDs
* Transaction details (purchase history)
* Product information
* Timestamps of customer interactions (website visits, product views etc.)

**Methodology:**
Our goal is to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and in-depth customer behavior analysis to generate actionable insights for ShopSmart.

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Merge the five datasets into a unified and cohesive data structure.
    * Clean and wrangle the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
    * Identify and address missing values or outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Analyze customer behavior patterns and trends.
    * Utilize visualization techniques to present findings effectively (charts, graphs).

3. **Feature Engineering:**
    * Create new features from event data to gain deeper customer insights.
    * Examples: Purchase frequency per category, average time spent on product pages.

4. **Customer Analysis:**
    * Identify customer visit frequency and any patterns in website visits.
    * Analyze customer location data and its potential impact on purchasing behavior.
    * Gain insights into overall website behavior and inform marketing strategies and personalized recommendations.

**Expected Outcome:**

This analysis will provide ShopSmart Inc. with a comprehensive understanding of its customer base. By leveraging the generated insights, ShopSmart can:

* **Optimize Website:** Improve website usability and user experience based on customer interaction patterns.
* **Refine Product Offerings:**  Tailor product offerings and recommendations based on customer preferences.
